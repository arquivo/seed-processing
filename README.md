# seed-processing
Script used to process urls to decide whether or not they are of good quality to collect

http://www.vivapraia.com/ is a good example of the difficulty of doing this type of analysis since the same URL can be attacked by different persons or the first attacker can change it to profit from other way. It is possible to see each versions preserved in Arquivo.pt from this website and how it changes over time and even today.
